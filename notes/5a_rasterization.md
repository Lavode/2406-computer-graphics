# Transformations


EXAM:
Linear maps: Matrix - vector product with matrix columns being linear transformations of unit vectors

## Matrix representation

- If wanting to do transformation with n steps, having to do n 3x3 matrix
  multiplications sucks.
  Alternative: Columns = images of unit vectors
  - Construct new unit vectors after transformation
  - Fill into matrix
