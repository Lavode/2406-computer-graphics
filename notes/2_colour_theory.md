# Colour theory

## Describing colours

- Names: Not quantitative enough?
- CMYK/RGB/HSB: Not qualitative enough?

### HSB

- Hue: Separate hues of colour
- Saturation: Add white, saturation goes down. Pure white = saturation 0
- Brightness

### Light in physics

- For purpose of CG: waves (for physics: also particles)
- Visible specturm: ~ 380 - 720 nm
- Coloured objects: Normally don't reflect one wavelength exclusively, but a
  whole spectrum of wavelengths in varying intensities
  - Hue => Dominant wavelength (or sum thereof)
  - Saturation: Exitation purity, ie spectrum only consisting of one peak = high saturation
  - Brightness: luminance

### Light in biology

- Varous receptors, which are sensitive to different spectrum of light in
  different intensities
- Many different power spectra lead to same perceived colour => Metamers

### CIE color system

- Negative coefficient: Obviously not able to measure directly (no anti-light),
  but measurement was done by adjusting reference colour until match achieved
  - added amount = negative peak

- Outcome: Three new colours X, Y, Z which do allow to create all possible colours
  together
  - Downside: No light sources exist which emits those three types of light
  - But X, Y, Z still valuable for quantification of colours

#### CIE chart

- Projected onto 2D, with perceived brightness being third (left-out) dimension
- Colours on curve: Spectral (=pure) light sources

### Colour systems

- RGB = CMY = HSV, since can be transformed into each other
- CIE separately => Able to encode more colours
