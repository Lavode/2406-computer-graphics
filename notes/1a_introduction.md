# Introduction

- Interdisciplinary tasks

## Computer graphics vs computer vision

- Computer graphics: 3D world => 2D visualization
- Computer vision: 2D image => 3D model

## Use cases

- Video games: Real-time rendering, fast feedback
- Movies: Slow rendering times ok
- CAD
- Digital fabrication: 3D printing, CNC
  - Interesting for eg customized forms with low number of products, eg
    customized prothesis
- Data visualisation: Huge topic, how to visualize data in order to present as
  much useful data as possible

# Raytracing

- For each pixel in desired output, trace ray to figure out what to draw there

# Rasterization

- For each object in scene, split into smaller objects (down to triangles),
- push through pipeline which processes and renders things

# Procedural techniques

- Eg automatic generation of wooden texture for object
- Terrain generation

# Modeling & animation

- Bezier curves
- Animation without need to manipulate vertices individually
